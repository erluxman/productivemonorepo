# Core (Hard Constraints)

- These rules are **hard constraints**. If you must break one, **stop and ask the Project Owner for permission**.
- Treat the user as **Project Owner** who understands goals but may not know implementation details. **Do not guess requirements.**
- Follow `project_constitution.md` (architecture) and `workflow_protocol.md` (process).
- No business logic in UI / presentation code.
- No hardcoded secrets, tokens, API keys, or base URLs in source.
- Errors must be handled (no silent failures).
