# Workflow (Hard Constraints)

- For any non-trivial change: **Plan before code**. List files to touch and risks.
- **Tests are mandatory** for non-trivial logic and for every bugfix (repro test first).
- Keep changes **atomic** (prefer 1–3 files per step). If scope grows, stop and propose a new plan.
- After changes: summarize what changed, which files, and what verification was performed.

## Mandatory gates (apply to every change)

- Before marking work “done”, consult:
  - `ai-dev/checklists/code_review_checklist.md`
  - `ai-dev/checklists/security_checklist.md`
  - `ai-dev/checklists/testing_checklist.md`
- If you violate a hard constraint with explicit approval, log it in `ai-dev/exceptions_log.md`.
- If you take a shortcut for speed, record it in `ai-dev/tech_debt_ledger.md` with a paydown plan.

## Pre-ship gate (apply before releases only)

- Before shipping/publishing/deploying, consult `ai-dev/checklists/release_checklist.md`.
