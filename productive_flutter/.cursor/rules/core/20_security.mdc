# Security (Hard Constraints)

- Never hardcode secrets (keys, tokens, passwords). Use environment/config mechanisms.
- Never weaken authentication/authorization without explicit approval.
- Validate/sanitize **all** external input at the boundary (API endpoints, storage reads, deep links).
- Never log sensitive data (tokens, passwords, PII). If uncertain, redact.
