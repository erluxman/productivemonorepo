# Flutter Development Rules

## Project Structure

- `lib/core/` - Services, providers, shared infrastructure
- `lib/features/` - Feature-based UI organization
- `lib/models/` - Data models
- `lib/utils/` - Utilities and extensions

## Active Rules

- `common_patterns.mdc` - State, UI, navigation, networking, auth, animations
- `performance.mdc` - Build optimization, const constructors, efficient rendering
- `error_handling.mdc` - Exception handling, error patterns
- `accessibility.mdc` - Semantics, screen readers, a11y support
- `testing.mdc` - Unit tests, widget tests, integration tests

## Core Principles

- No business logic in widgets
- Services in `lib/core/`, UI in `lib/features/`
- Handle all errors explicitly
- Use const constructors where possible
- Keep files focused and cohesive
